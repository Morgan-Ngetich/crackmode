# Find the Difference

**Difficulty:** <span style={{color: "#4ade80"}}>Easy</span>  
**LeetCode:** [389. Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

---

## Problem

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "ae", t = "aea"
Output: "a"
Explanation: 'a' is the letter that was added.
```

## Simple Explanation

Think of this like **counting items** in two bags!

Just like in real life:
- Bag A has: 1 apple, 1 banana, 1 cherry
- Bag B has: 1 apple, 1 banana, 1 cherry, 1 grape → grape is the extra item! ✓

**The Plan:** Count how many times each letter appears in both strings. The letter that appears more in `t` is our answer!

      code: `from collections import Counter

def find_the_difference(s, t):

        if letter not in s_count or count != s_count[letter]:

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

Let's trace through `s = "abcd"`, `t = "abcde"`:

```
Step 1: Count letters in s = "abcd"
        s_count = {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1, 'd': 1}

Step 2: Count letters in t = "abcde"  
        t_count = {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1, 'd': 1, 'e': 1}

Step 3: Compare counts for each letter in t
        'a': t has 1, s has 1 → Same ✓
        'b': t has 1, s has 1 → Same ✓
        'c': t has 1, s has 1 → Same ✓
        'd': t has 1, s has 1 → Same ✓
        'e': t has 1, s has 0 (doesn't exist) → Different! ✓

Result: 'e' is the extra letter!
```

Let's try another example: `s = "ae"`, `t = "aea"`:

```
Step 1: Count letters in s = "ae"
        s_count = {'a': 1, 'e': 1}

Step 2: Count letters in t = "aea"
        t_count = {'a': 2, 'e': 1}

Step 3: Compare counts
        'a': t has 2, s has 1 → Different! ✓
        
Result: 'a' is the extra letter!
```

## Alternative Simple Approach

If you want an even simpler approach (though less efficient), you can check each letter:

```python
def find_the_difference_simple(s, t):
    # Try each letter in t
    for letter in t:
        # Count how many times it appears in both strings
        count_in_s = s.count(letter)
        count_in_t = t.count(letter)
        
        # If counts are different, this is our answer
        if count_in_t > count_in_s:
            return letter
    
    return ''
```

This is slower but very easy to understand!

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting edge cases:** What if `s` is empty? The solution still works!

2. **Assuming only new letters:** The extra letter might be a duplicate, not a new one

3. **Not handling missing keys:** Always check if a letter exists in the dictionary

4. **Overcomplicating:** The counting approach is simple and works for all cases

## Test Cases to Try

```python
# Test your solution with these:
print(find_the_difference("abcd", "abcde"))    # Should return "e"
print(find_the_difference("", "y"))            # Should return "y"  
print(find_the_difference("ae", "aea"))        # Should return "a"
print(find_the_difference("a", "aa"))          # Should return "a"
print(find_the_difference("ymbgaraibkfmvocpizdydugvalagaivdbfhvbksexkfrzrfrukndvuaobvfvwmmpnqivjyihhhwjuwfjmcryrz"))

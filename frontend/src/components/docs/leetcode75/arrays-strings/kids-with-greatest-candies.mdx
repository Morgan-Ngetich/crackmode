## Problem

There are `n` kids with candies. You are given an integer array `candies`, where each `candies[i]` represents the number of candies the `ith` kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return a boolean array `result` of length `n`, where `result[i]` is `true` if, after giving the `ith` kid all the `extraCandies`, they will have the **greatest number of candies** among all the kids, or `false` otherwise.

Note that **multiple kids** can have the **greatest number of candies**.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true]
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1: 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids
- Kid 2: 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids
- Kid 3: 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids
- Kid 4: 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids
- Kid 5: 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false]
Explanation: There is only one kid who can have the greatest number of candies.
```

## Simple Explanation

Think of this as a **"what if" game**:

1. Find the kid who currently has the **most candies**
2. For each kid, ask: "If I give them ALL extra candies, will they have at least as many as the current leader?"
3. If yes → `true`, if no → `false`

It's like checking if each player can become the champion with a power-up!

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

Let's trace through `candies = [2,3,5,1,3]`, `extraCandies = 3`:

```
Step 1: Find maximum candies
        max(2,3,5,1,3) = 5

Step 2: Check each kid
        Kid 0: 2 + 3 = 5 >= 5? ✓ true
        Kid 1: 3 + 3 = 6 >= 5? ✓ true  
        Kid 2: 5 + 3 = 8 >= 5? ✓ true
        Kid 3: 1 + 3 = 4 >= 5? ✗ false
        Kid 4: 3 + 3 = 6 >= 5? ✓ true

Result: [true, true, true, false, true]
```

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity: O(n)**
- Finding maximum: O(n)
- Building result array: O(n)
- Total: O(n) where n = number of kids

**Space Complexity: O(1)**
- Only using constant extra space
- Output array doesn't count toward space complexity
